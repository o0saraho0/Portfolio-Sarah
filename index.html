              <p>
                "Step out of your comfort zone" has been the guiding theme of my
                life. After a six-year career as an academic consultant, I
                co-founded Walnut Education â€” a platform that connects
                consultants and students, much like Airbnb connects hosts and
                guests. Our team built a comprehensive online marketplace from
                scratch.<br /><br />

                While I initially focused on product design at Walnut, my time
                there ignited my passion for coding. As we developed new
                features, I actively contributed to building the platform,
                learning programming through hands-on experience.

                <br /><br />

                In 2024, I took a leap and enrolled in App Academy to deepen my
                technical expertise. Now, I'm dedicated to building my software
                engineering portfolio and am eagerly exploring exciting job
                opportunities in the tech industry.

          <p class="content">
            Walnut Education is a platform I engineered from the ground up in
            collaboration with two other engineers, with the mission to promote
            transparency and provide diverse choices in the college admissions
            consulting industry. Inspired by the Airbnb model, this platform
            connects students seeking application guidance with a variety of
            consultants, creating an intuitive space where students act as
            guests and consultants as hosts.

            <br /><br />

            The platform is packed with essential features, including an
            advanced search functionality, real-time chat for instant
            communication, payment processing to simplify transactions, and a
            review system that helps students make informed decisions. We
            successfully registered over 121 consultants, offering a broad
            selection of expertise to match students' unique needs.

            <br /><br />

            Our efforts were recognized when Walnut Education ranked among Y
            Combinator's top 10% of applicants in 2021, further validating the
            platform's potential to reshape the consulting experience by
            seamlessly integrating complex functionalities into a user-centered
            approach. This project demonstrates my ability to build full-fledged
            platforms that address real-world needs and deliver a seamless and
            transparent consulting process.

            HelloWorld is a dynamic and feature-rich travel planning application
            that I developed as my capstone project during the App Academy
            coding bootcamp. Inspired by Wanderlog, I built this full-stack solo
            project within just two weeks.

            <br /><br />

            The frontend of the application is powered by React, while the
            backend is supported by Flask. I incorporated a variety of
            technologies, including Leaflet for interactive maps, JavaScript,
            Python, Redux, SQLite3, PostgreSQL and AWS S3 for image storage,.
            AWS allows seamless image uploads and retrieval, enhancing user
            experience by providing fast and reliable media handling.

            <br /><br />

            One of the standout features of HelloWorld is its AI-powered travel
            assistant, which provides intelligent itinerary suggestions and
            personalized recommendations. By utilizing AI-based fetching, the
            application helps users plan trips with real-time insights and
            optimized travel routes effortlessly.

            <br /><br />
            This project highlights my ability to integrate complex tools and
            frameworks to deliver a fully functional, user-friendly travel
            planning application.

            technologies, including JavaScript, Node.js, CSS, CSS Grid, HTML,
            SQLite3, PostgreSQL, and Redux. The application features full CRUD
            functionality for both reviews and listings, allowing users to
            create, read, update, and delete reviews and listings seamlessly
            within the platform.

            This project demonstrates my technical expertise in full-stack
            development and highlights my ability to independently build a
            feature-rich, responsive application with a seamless user experience
            across multiple devices.
